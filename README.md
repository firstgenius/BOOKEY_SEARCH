# BOOKEY_SEARCH
BOOKEY SEARCH promotes children's literature. With its help you can easily search on key topics such as: Author; BL record ID; Type of resource; BNB number; ISBN; Title; Country of publication; Place of publication; Publisher; Date of publication; Edition; Physical description; Dewey classification; BL shelfmark; Genre; Languages; Useful information; and keywords in these topics to find books that fit this description.  BOOKEY SEARCH uses The British Library 'Children's Literature' dataset, which is a set of .csv (comma-separated value) files containing metadata for Children's literature resources from the British National Bibliography (BNB) and The British Library collections. It includes both fiction and non-fiction resources and is updated annually.
