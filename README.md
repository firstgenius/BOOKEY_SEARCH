BOOKEY SEARCH promotes children's literature. With its help you can easily search on key topics such as: Author; BL record ID; Type of resource; BNB number; ISBN; Title; Country of publication; Place of publication; Publisher; Date of publication; Edition; Physical description; Dewey classification; BL shelfmark; Genre; Languages; Useful information; and keywords in these topics to find books that fit this description.

BOOKEY SEARCH uses The British Library 'Children's Literature' dataset, which is a set of .csv (comma-separated value) files containing metadata for Children's literature resources from the British National Bibliography (BNB) and The British Library collections. It includes both fiction and non-fiction resources and is updated annually.

This program helps people find the necessary children's literature, knowing incomplete information about the desired book. Also, knowing which genre, type, book, which author or publisher you want to read, this program will be useful to you.
